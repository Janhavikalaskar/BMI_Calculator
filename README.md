# BMI_Calculator

Project Description:

Create a simple Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator that allows users to enter their height and
weight to calculate their BMI. The BMI calculator will display the calculated BMI value and a
corresponding message indicating whether the user is underweight, normal weight, overweight,
or obese.

Key Features:

1. Input Fields: Provide input fields for users to enter their height (in meters or feet and inches)
and weight (in kilograms or pounds).

2. BMI Calculation: Calculate the BMI using the formula `BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) *
height (m))` or an equivalent formula for imperial units.

3. BMI Classification: Determine the user's BMI category based on predefined ranges (e.g.,
underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese).

5. Result Display: Display the calculated BMI value and the corresponding classification on the
webpage.

7. Clear/Reset Button: Include a button to clear the input fields and results for the user to
perform another calculation.

Technologies:

You can build this project using HTML for the user interface, JavaScript for the BMI calculation
and interaction, and CSS for styling. JavaScript will handle the logic of calculating the BMI and
determining the classification.

This project is a great way to practice basic input handling, mathematical calculations, and
conditional statements in JavaScript while providing a useful tool for users to assess their BMI
